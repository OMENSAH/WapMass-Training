// class helps to create objects
// class name is the same as file name;
// class has features called properties;
// class has actions called methods.
// In all, class is made up of bunch of statements
// each statement ends with semicolon.
// And a statement can contain statements.
// A java program might have multiple classes but it must have only one entry point to start the application.
// Entry point in Java is a method, "main" method.

class Statements{
// entry point 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Anything you want to be started when we run the application must be  here.
    
   System.out.println(" Hey this is my first java program");
